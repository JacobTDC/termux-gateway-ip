This is a little project that is able to get the current network's gateway IP on Termux, done as a demonstration.

To build on device, you'll need to setup sdkmanager and set your ANDROID\_HOME environment variable, and add `android.aapt2FromMavenOverride=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/aapt2` to your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties.
